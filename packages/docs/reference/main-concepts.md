# Main Concepts of **SOMOD**

SOMOD makes it easy to **Develop**, **Build** and **Deploy** Serverless Applications

In this guide, we will examine the concepts used in SOMOD projects. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from smaller reusable modules.

This reference is a step-by-step guide to explaining the main concepts of SOMOD. You can find the list of all concepts in the left navigation bar under [Reference](/reference)/[Main Concepts](/reference/main-concepts).
